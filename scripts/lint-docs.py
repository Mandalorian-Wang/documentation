"""Documentation lint for the BoxLite docs tree.

Currently enforces STYLE_GUIDE §12: no soft promises. "Not supported" is a fact a
reader can act on; "coming soon" is a promise nobody dated.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/lint-docs.py <docs_dir>

Exits non-zero on any violation, so it can gate CI.

The checker is fence-aware and inline-code-aware: a banned phrase inside a code
block or inline `code` span is a quoted SDK error message, not prose, and is
skipped. Prose exceptions are listed in ALLOWED_LINES.
